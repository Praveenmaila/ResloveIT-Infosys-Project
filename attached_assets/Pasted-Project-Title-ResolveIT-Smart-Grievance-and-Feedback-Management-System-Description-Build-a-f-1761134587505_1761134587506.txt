Project Title: ResolveIT – Smart Grievance and Feedback Management System

🧾 Description

Build a full-stack web application called ResolveIT, an online complaint and grievance management platform that improves transparency and efficiency in handling IT (Information Technology) grievances.

The platform enables users to submit, track, and manage complaints either anonymously or via verified login, while admins can review, resolve, or escalate them.
